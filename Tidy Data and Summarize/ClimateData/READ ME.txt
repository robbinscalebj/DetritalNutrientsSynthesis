raw data are netcdf files with monthly mean precip and temperature data from Cru for 0.5 x 0.5 lat/long grids across global surface. Data covers years ~1960-2015.

Taken from Copernicus data user guide: 
"The CRU TS (Climatic Research Unit gridded Time Series) dataset provides a high-resolution, monthly grid of land-based (excluding Antarctica) 
observations going back to 1901 and consists of ten observed and derived variables. 
There are no missing values in the defined domain. Individual station series are anomalised using their 1961–1990 observations, 
then gridded to a 0.5° regular grid using angular distance weighting (ADW); the resulting anomaly grids are converted to actuals 
(values, not anomalies) for publication using the CRU CL v1.0 climatologies. 
 Within this CDS record, only temperature and daily extremes have been published."
