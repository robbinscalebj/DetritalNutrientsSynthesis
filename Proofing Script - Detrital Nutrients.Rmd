```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This Rmarkdown will be used to proof every incoming data file for the detrital nutrients synthesis. The code needs to 
1) Read in a file in a list
2) Check the file for consistency (throw errors if inconsistent)
3) Iterate these actions


```{r Read in Data}
#The following code assumes working directory is set where the Detrital Nutrients .csv files are located
DetNut_Files<-list.files("./DetNut_CSVs", full.names = TRUE)#Pulls names of files into a list to be called later

DetNut<-DetNut_Files%>%
